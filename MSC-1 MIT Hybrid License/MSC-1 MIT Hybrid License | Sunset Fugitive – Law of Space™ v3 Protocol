### 1. Metadata Integrity (Non-Negotiable)

All metadata and cryptographic tags must remain **INTACT and unaltered**:
- Ghost ID™ (unique cryptographic identifier)
- Watermark frequencies (16 Hz, 18 Hz, 34 Hz)
- black_it.py identifiers and PQC signatures
- MSC-1 certification markers
- NO-TRAIN clause status

Any removal, obfuscation, or alteration of these identifiers is strictly prohibited.

### 2. Attribution Requirement

Clear and public credit to **Sunset Fugitive** must be included in:
- All derivative works

- Public documentation

Attribution format:
```
"Based on Sunset Fugitive™ PQC Audio Watermark Engine v5

Certification: CSP 23-921841"
```

### 3. Permanent AI Training Opt-Out (NO-TRAIN Clause)

The registration of any Asset under this License constitutes an explicit and **IRREVOCABLE PERMANENT AI TRAINING OPT-OUT**.

**The use of this Software or any Assets protected by it for training, scraping, fine-tuning, or modeling in ANY Generative AI, Machine Learning, or Large Language Model dataset is strictly prohibited.**

Violation of this clause constitutes:
- Immediate breach of the MSC-1 MIT-Hybrid License
- Infringement under Law of Space™ v3 Protocol
- Grounds for legal enforcement action
- $10,000,000 USD liquidated damages per violation

### 4. Cryptographic Integrity

All cryptographic operations must use the **PQC Cryptographic Suite** as defined in the Terms and Conditions:

- **PQC Key Exchange**: ML-KEM-1024 (Kyber lattice, NIST FIPS 203)
- **PQC Digital Signature**: ML-DSA Falcon-1024 (NIST PQC finalist)
- **Key Derivation Function**: Argon2id (IETF RFC 9106)
- **Classical Encryption**: AES-256-GCM (NIST SP 800-38D)
- **Hash Function**: SHAKE256 (FIPS 202)

Any modification to the cryptographic implementation requires written permission from Sunset Fugitive.

### 5. Watermark Non-Removal

The Ghost ID™ watermark embedded in protected Assets:
- Is forensic proof of ownership
- Cannot be removed without extreme audio/data degradation
- Is non-negotiable for legal enforcement
- Violation = infringement under Law of Space™ v3
